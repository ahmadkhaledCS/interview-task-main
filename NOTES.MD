- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
If you're a teacher and you want to know how different a kid is
from the other students, you can utilize normalization to get a
more precise assessment based on his z-score since it basically 
measures how different he is from the average.
```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
Before deploying code in a work environment, we must ensure that
it meets all of the requirements. Unit tests ensure us that 
everything is working as planned.
```
- What is the IDE did you use?
```
IntelliJ Ultimate
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
I only used The official core Java API and GSON 
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
When computing the standard deviation,
I encountered numerous rounding errors. 
In standard deviation I had to use CEILING rather than HALF EVEN.
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mention it in this file
```
1)Provide an executable jar file which allows the evaluator to use the implemented utility through command line
2)Support another type of files, like XML or json i picked json
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
I learned a lot of new skills, including: 
1)using unit tests and understanding them 
2)creating an executable jar file
3)maven essentials 
4)better understanding of interfaces
5)error handling and trowing exceptions
```
